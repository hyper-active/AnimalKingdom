Please use me to log all awesome adventures in anyway possible. Not limited to HTML. Or Java. Or CSS.
Maybe a combination of other weird languages.
Maybe something absract.
Maybe nothing.

MAYBE ALL THE LANGUAGES.

Let's make this a beautiful 1990's themed 2047 version of the first 2001 website to be shown in a movie back in 2014 using HTML as a way to explain unix shell, python and latex. Possibly.

There used to be easter eggs here, but there left. Bring them back !
