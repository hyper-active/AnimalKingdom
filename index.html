    <p>I really enjoyed going to an exhibition with you, so thought I'd have a look to see if there's anything we could go to this weekend. 
    Will add things if I find anything new. Feel free to add too if you hear of anything!</p>

I hope you have a good week at work and also with your ping pong competition!-->

 <h1>Exhibitions</h1>

    <p><a href="https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/david-hockney-portraits">This looks interesting too. Lots of portraits!</a></a></p>
  <!--It's all quite abstract, but that can be okay. Sometimes-->

  <h1>CoolSite</h1>
    <p><a href="https://cvdazzle.com/">Have you seen this? It's pretty cool</a></p>
  <!-- I'm not thinking of getting any of these harcuts, but I like the idea. And that someone thought of this. Like Edward Snowdens hairdresser -->
      <p><a href="https://thescribblepen.com/">And this magic pen! I love it. Not sure if I'd use it much though...</a></p>     
       <p><a href="https://eu.vibram.com/en/shop/furoshiki/">Also these crazy shoes that just wrap around your foot.</a></p>
        <p><a href="http://www.hypercell.co.uk/">oooh and I want lots of these little blocks!.</a></p>

<!-- It was so hard choosing a Paddle/bat/racket. But I've ordered one now! And balls. 
I think they are fluorescent, so...we can play in the dark? We'll see.
I've also bought a book that I think you'll find interesting. xxx -->
