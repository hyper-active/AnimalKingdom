<marquee behavior="alternate">Hi Natalia!</marquee>  
    <p>I really enjoyed going to an exhibition with you, so thought I'd have a look to see if there's anything we could go to this weekend. 
    Will add things if I find anything new. Feel free to add too if you hear of anything!</p>

<!-- It was so hard choosing a Paddle/bat/racket. But I've ordered one now! And balls. 
I think they are fluorescent, so...we can play in the dark? We'll see.
I've also bought a book that I think you'll find interesting. xxx -->
